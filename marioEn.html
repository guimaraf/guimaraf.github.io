            <h2 class="content-subhead">About the development of the fangame</h2>

            <p>In late 2015 and early 2016, when I was learning about the world of programming and game development, I decided to study 
                platform game mechanics with what is considered by many to be one of the best of all time in the category, "I include myself 
                in this group", using the engine <a href="https://www.scirra.com/construct2" target="_blank" >Construct 2</a>, which is designed by 
                <a href="https://www.scirra.com" target="_blank" >Scirra</a>. 
                An ideal tool for those with little or no programming experience.
            </p>

            <p>I implemented several mechanics, such as level selection equal to the game's, transformations, scenarios with different themes, traps, 
                enemies, ending with a boss. The project was so good to work on, that it started to get too big, I created a game mode 
                I created a game mode that is literally a bomberman within the Mario game, I started to adapt the gameplay to cooperative, added new 
                transformations, reaching a point that I decided to stop the development, because the time invested and the knowledge acquired have already 
                the need initially planned.
            </p>

            <p>Obs. Currently on the official website of the <a href="https://www.scirra.com/arcade/adventure-games/super-mario-bros-6115" target="_blank" >Scirra Arcade</a>, 
                the game has more than <b>34,000 times played</b>, with a rating of <b>4 stars</b>.
            </p>

            <p>Now in 2018, I decided to make some more updates, and make the ranking available for the game, using the Scirra API, so 
                so every time you give Game Over or manage to beat the Boss, your score is sent to the Scirra site.<br>
                To make this mechanic interesting, I had to fix several small problems in the game, such as shaky animations, uneven colliders, AI of some enemies, Mario's physics, physics of blocks, behavior of items before triggering upgrade 
                enemies, Mario's physics, physics of the blocks, behavior of items before triggering the upgrade, was very good to revisit the project 
                good to revisit the project, note how much I evouved from the time it was produced to the present date.<br><br>

                As could not be different, there are some surprises hidden in the game, is a way to thank people who gave a great 
                I will also be making available the CAPX of the game, which will also be available on Scirra's website.
